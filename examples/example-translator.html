  <!-- Load dictionary on window load, you may want to change this according to your needs.
  To demonstrate this program, it's just done on window load though.
  NOTE: This program implies that the CMU IPA dictionary (http://people.umass.edu/nconstan/CMU-IPA/)
  has been loaded with loadDict(). This dictionary is by default included with this
  program under the name 'ipadict.txt'. This _WILL NOT WORK_ with any other IPA dictionary.
  -->
  <script>
    // Chrome will error here, therefore it isnt the dev browser of choice. Use Firefox instead.
    // This is because the `loadDict()` method will use an XHTTP Request to get the file, which chrome won't like because
    // It's on the local machine. If you try to read the file from say, the GitHub repository, it *still* won't work,
    // because it's not hosted on the same site. It's not worth the trouble to use a workaround especially when the program
    // works as intended when used on a live website. See http://surrsur.us/projects/ipa/english-to-ipa.html.
//    window.onload = TextToIPA.loadDict('../lib/ipadict.txt');
    window.onload = TextToIPA.loadDictByObj(IPADict);

      As you can see, when this buton is pressed, the conver() function is ran
      where the input, output, and error IDs are given as parameters.
      These can be set to whatever you like, as long as inID and outID are text areas, and errID is a div.
